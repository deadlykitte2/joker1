# MikroTik Remote Access Service Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a VPS-based MikroTik remote connection service using VPS IP: **16.28.86.103**

## Research Summary

### Popular VPN Solutions for MikroTik Remote Management

#### 1. OpenVPN (Most Common)
**Advantages:**
- Widely supported across all MikroTik devices
- Mature and stable protocol
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Works well behind NAT/firewalls
- Uses TCP protocol (MikroTik only supports TCP for OpenVPN)

**Setup Architecture:**
- VPS acts as OpenVPN Server
- MikroTik router acts as OpenVPN Client
- Client connects to VPS IP (16.28.86.103) on port 1194 (or 443 for stealth)
- Secure tunnel established for remote management

#### 2. WireGuard (Modern Alternative)
**Advantages:**
- Better performance than OpenVPN
- Lower CPU usage
- Simpler configuration
- Modern cryptography
- Faster connection establishment

**Considerations:**
- Newer protocol, less widespread adoption
- Requires RouterOS v7.1+ for full support
- May require more technical knowledge

#### 3. SSTP/L2TP
**Advantages:**
- Good for Windows environments
- Can bypass some firewalls

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex setup
- Limited MikroTik support compared to OpenVPN

## Recommended Architecture

### Phase 1: OpenVPN Setup (Recommended Start)

```
[MikroTik Router] ---> [Internet] ---> [VPS: 16.28.86.103] ---> [Management Interface]
     (Client)                           (OpenVPN Server)              (Winbox/WebFig)
```

### Components Needed:

1. **VPS Configuration (16.28.86.103):**
   - Ubuntu/Debian server
   - OpenVPN server installation
   - Certificate Authority (CA) setup
   - Client certificate generation
   - Firewall configuration
   - Port forwarding setup

2. **MikroTik Router Configuration:**
   - OpenVPN client setup
   - Certificate import
   - Interface configuration
   - Routing and firewall rules

3. **Management Interface:**
   - Web-based dashboard for client management
   - Certificate generation automation
   - Connection monitoring
   - Client status tracking

## Business Model Research

### Commercial MikroTik Remote Access Services typically offer:

1. **Subscription-based access**
   - Monthly/yearly plans
   - Per-device pricing
   - Tiered service levels

2. **Features:**
   - Secure tunnel establishment
   - Multi-device support
   - Connection monitoring
   - Automated certificate management
   - 24/7 connectivity
   - Backup connections

3. **Target Market:**
   - IT service providers
   - Network administrators
   - Small to medium businesses
   - Remote locations without static IPs

## Next Steps

1. Set up OpenVPN server on VPS (16.28.86.103)
2. Create automated certificate generation system
3. Develop web interface for client management
4. Test with sample MikroTik device
5. Create documentation and setup guides
6. Implement monitoring and logging
7. Scale for multiple clients

## Technical Requirements

- VPS with root access (16.28.86.103)
- Domain name (optional but recommended)
- SSL certificates for web interface
- Database for client management
- Monitoring tools

## Security Considerations

- Strong certificate-based authentication
- Regular certificate rotation
- Access logging and monitoring
- Firewall rules and rate limiting
- Regular security updates
- Encrypted client data storage
