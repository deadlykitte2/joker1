# üöÄ MikroTik Remote Access - One-Click VPS Deployment

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Deploy a complete, bulletproof MikroTik remote access service on any Ubuntu VPS:

### Step 1: Download and Deploy
```bash
# Connect to your fresh Ubuntu VPS as root
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Download and run the deployment script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/mikrotik-remote-access/main/vps-one-click-deploy.sh
chmod +x vps-one-click-deploy.sh
./vps-one-click-deploy.sh
```

### Step 2: Create First Client
```bash
# After deployment completes, create your first client
create-mikrotik-autoconfig customer-test 10.8.0.10 8300 8090 22050
```

### Step 3: Customer Setup
Send your customer this link (output from step 2):
```
http://YOUR_VPS_IP/clients/customer-test/instructions.html
```

Customer process:
1. Opens the webpage
2. Downloads RouterOS script for their version
3. Uploads to MikroTik via Winbox ‚Üí Files
4. Runs: `/import setup-ros6.rsc` (or setup-ros7.rsc)
5. Gets immediate remote access
